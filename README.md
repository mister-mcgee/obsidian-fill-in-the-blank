# Fill in the Blank (FITB) Plugin for Obsidian

Great for educators and students alike who use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) to write and print notes. Use `--magic--` to render inline text as blank line(s) instead.

### Usage
Simply wrap text in double dashes (e.g. `Fill in the --Blank--?`). When the text is rendered it will now appear as blank line(s) (e.g. `Fill in the __________?`). The FITB markdown post-processor will transform headings, paragraphs, and even code blocks inline. The FITB plugin provides a quick and easy way to toggle text inline. Simply highlight the desired text and select the FITB icon in the ribbon, or bind the `fill-in-the-blank:toggle` command to a hotkey.

To enable or disable FITB while still allowing the post-processor to consume the syntax, add the following snippet to your document's frontmatter.
```yml
---
fitb: false
---
```
⚠️ You may need to reopen/reload the preview window to see frontmatter changes take effect.
